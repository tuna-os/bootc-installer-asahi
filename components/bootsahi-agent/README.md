# bootsahi-agent

D1's first-boot agent for the "bootsahi" bootstrap image (see
[`docs/DESIGN.md`](../../docs/DESIGN.md)): translates `install-config.json`
(written by the Bootsahi macOS app onto the ESP) into a
[fisherman](https://github.com/projectbluefin/fisherman) `recipe.json` and
drives an unattended `bootc install to-filesystem`.

**Fork choice matters here.** wootc (the Windows sibling of this project,
see [issue #6](https://github.com/tuna-os/bootc-installer-asahi/issues/6))
vendors `projectbluefin/fisherman`, which has real fixes `tuna-os/fisherman`
lacks as of 2026-07-18 (six days stale at time of writing): an explicit
`mount -t` for the freshly-formatted root (the deployer initramfs can't
probe the filesystem type, so an xfs root gets attempted as ext4 and fails),
and `chroot <target> useradd` instead of `useradd --root` (`--root` also
initializes the *host's* PAM/SELinux stack and fails against an otherwise
perfectly writable target). Point `BOOTSAHI_FISHERMAN_BIN` at a binary
built from `projectbluefin/fisherman`, not `tuna-os/fisherman`.

**Not** `bootc install to-disk` — that path (used by this repo's own
`scripts/make-payload.sh` / `scripts/test-payload.sh`) is debug/QEMU-only,
where fisherman partitions a scratch disk itself. In the real flow the
asahi-installer backend has already partitioned the disk on the macOS side
(stub macOS, ESP, root partition), so this agent hands fisherman those
pre-made partitions via `recipe.json`'s `customMounts`, never its
disk-auto-partition path.

## Contract

- Locates `install-config.json` at `<ESP>/bootsahi/install-config.json`
  (candidates: `/boot/efi`, `/efi`, `/boot` — same ESP-detection convention
  as [`asahi-bootbin-sync`](../asahi-bootbin-sync)). Override with
  `BOOTSAHI_CONFIG_PATH` for testing.
- Schema: [`install-config.schema.json`](install-config.schema.json).
- Optional Wi-Fi connect (`nmcli`) if `wifi.ssid` is present; non-fatal on
  failure (ethernet may still work).
- Optional cosign signature verification when `cosignIdentity` is set —
  refuses to deploy an unverified image if `cosign` isn't installed in the
  bootstrap. `BOOTSAHI_SKIP_VERIFY=1` is a dev/test-only escape hatch, never
  for production bootstrap images.
- Builds a fisherman recipe with `customMounts` (ESP + root, both
  pre-partitioned), `bootloader: "systemd"` (per fisherman's own docs, this
  is the setting for Bluefin/Dakota-style systemd-boot images — which is
  every TunaOS/Dakota/Bluefin Asahi target), and `imageType: "bootc"`.
- Shreds the generated recipe.json after a successful install (it carries the
  LUKS passphrase / user password in the clear); `BOOTSAHI_RUN_DIR` is
  tmpfs-backed in production, so this is belt-and-braces.
- Reboots into the installed system on success unless `BOOTSAHI_NO_REBOOT=1`.

### Exit codes (load-bearing — the bootstrap's greetd session branches on these)

| Code | Meaning | greetd fallback |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `0`  | Installed successfully | none — the agent already rebooted |
| `2`  | No `install-config.json` yet (expected first-boot state) | show the interactive fisherman-driven UI (`tuna-installer-*`; contract documented as `INSTALLER-FRONTENDS.md` in tuna-os/tunaOS) |
| `1`  | Config present but the install failed | show the interactive UI, with `/run/bootsahi/install.log` surfaced for diagnosis |

## Ship it in every bootsahi bootstrap image

- script → `/usr/libexec/bootsahi-agent`
- unit → `/usr/lib/systemd/system/bootsahi-agent.service` (+ preset enable,
  `WantedBy=multi-user.target`)

Requires `jq` and (for install) the `fisherman` binary reachable on `$PATH`.
`nmcli` and `cosign` are optional — their absence only disables the
corresponding feature (Wi-Fi connect, signature verification) rather than
failing the whole agent, except that a `cosignIdentity` in the config with no
`cosign` binary is treated as a hard failure (refuse to deploy unverified).

## Testing

`./test-agent.sh` exercises the full exit-code contract and the recipe.json
shape using `/bin/true` / `/bin/false` / `cat` as fisherman stand-ins — no
real disks, network, or fisherman/bootc binary required. Run on every change:

```sh
./test-agent.sh
```
