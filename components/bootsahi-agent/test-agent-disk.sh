# test-agent-disk.sh — prove the agent picks the RIGHT partition, against a real
# GPT disk with real PARTUUIDs.
#
# test-agent.sh covers the config->recipe transform with /dev/null placeholders.
# It cannot cover the question that actually destroys machines: given a disk
# carrying both the bootstrap the agent is running from AND the target it may
# format, does the agent choose correctly, and does it refuse when it cannot
# prove ownership? (issues #19, #22)
#
# So this builds a loopback GPT disk shaped like a real install — ESP +
# Bootstrap + Target — reads back the PARTUUIDs the kernel actually assigned,
# and drives the agent through them. fisherman is still a stub here: this
# asserts SELECTION, not formatting. Running the real fisherman against this
# disk is issue #26.
