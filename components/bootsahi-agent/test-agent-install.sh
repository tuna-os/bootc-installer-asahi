# test-agent-install.sh — run the REAL fisherman through a REAL install against a
# disposable loop disk, and prove what it did and did not touch. (issue #26)
#
# Everything before this test was producer-side. test-agent.sh checks the
# config->recipe transform, test-agent-disk.sh checks partition SELECTION with a
# recording stub, and the `fisherman validate` step added there checks that the
# recipe PARSES. None of them execute an install, so none of them can observe
# consumer semantics — what fisherman actually does to the disk when it runs.
#
# That gap is why this exists. The `vfat` defect (#17) survived every
# producer-side assertion because the recipe looked right to us; it would have
# died mid-install, after partitioning. `validate` catches that specific class
# now, but validate is a parser, and the questions that destroy someone's Mac
# are not parse questions:
#
#   - does fstype "unformatted" really skip mkfs on the ESP, or merely skip a
#     check? The ESP holds m1n1, boot.bin, the bootloader, and vendorfw/ —
#     Apple firmware extracted on-device that we may not redistribute. mkfs
#     there means a DFU restore, and the user's macOS is gone with it.
#   - does the install stay inside the partition it was given, or does it touch
#     neighbours? On a real Mac the neighbours are the user's macOS install.
#   - does the bootstrap partition — the one the agent is RUNNING from — survive?
#
# So: seed a canary on every partition, run the real thing, and assert
# preservation and mutation explicitly, per partition. A canary that survives
# where it should have died is as much a failure as the reverse; "the install
# passed" is not evidence that it installed anything.
#
# This is destructive by design, but only to a loop file in a temp dir. It
# refuses to run against anything that is not a loop device.
#
