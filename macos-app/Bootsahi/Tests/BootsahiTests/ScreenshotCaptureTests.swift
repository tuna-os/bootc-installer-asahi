/// Renders every screen of the installer to PNG, plus an animated walkthrough,

///
/// **Why a test target rather than a `swift run` tool.** `Bootsahi` is an
/// executable target, and SwiftPM will not let a second non-test target import
/// one. The choices were to split the app into a library plus a thin shim — a
/// refactor touching every file, verified by no local compiler — or to use the
/// one target that is already allowed to `@testable import` it and already runs
/// in CI. The second is smaller and reuses a harness that demonstrably works.
///
/// **Why a real NSWindow rather than `ImageRenderer`.** The first version of
/// this used `ImageRenderer`, on the reasoning that offscreen rendering avoids
/// the window-server flake a screenshot job would have. That reasoning was
/// wrong in a way the output made obvious and the CI check did not:
/// `ImageRenderer` draws SwiftUI's own primitives fine — text, symbols, shapes,
/// the CoreImage QR — but it cannot draw AppKit-backed CONTROLS. Buttons came
/// out as the yellow/red "unsupported view" placeholder, and `Form`, `List`,
/// `Slider` and `TextField` did not come out at all. The settings screen
/// rendered as a title over an empty page, and the catalog screen was 57%
/// placeholder block. Every published screenshot was missing the very controls
/// a walkthrough exists to point at.
///
/// So the views are hosted in an `NSHostingView` inside a real (never ordered
/// on screen) `NSWindow`, and captured with `cacheDisplay(in:to:)`. The
/// controls are then genuine NSViews in a genuine view hierarchy and draw
/// themselves properly. It still needs no visible window, no focus and no
/// timing guesswork.
///
/// What is still absent, honestly: the title bar and the vibrancy behind
/// `.bar`, because those belong to window chrome the capture does not include.
///
/// Writes nothing unless `BOOTSAHI_CAPTURE_DIR` is set, so a normal `swift
/// test` stays a test run.
