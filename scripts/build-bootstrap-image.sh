# build-bootstrap-image.sh — build the bootsahi bootstrap image (issue #27).
#
# Until this existed, the payload pipeline repackaged a stock desktop image, so
# what CI produced contained no bootsahi-agent, no unit, no fisherman and no
# cosign. "The payload boots" was demonstrated; "the bootstrap installs
# anything" was never tested, because there was nothing to test.
#
# Staging happens here rather than in the Containerfile because the sources live
# in components/ and scripts/ — a Containerfile cannot COPY from outside its
# build context, and making the repo root the context would ship the whole tree
# into the image.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build-bootstrap-image.sh [tag]
# Env:
#   BASE_IMAGE           base to derive from (default: bonito gnome-asahi)
#   FISHERMAN_REPO/REV   which fisherman to vendor, pinned by default
#   SKIP_FISHERMAN_BUILD =1 to reuse an already-staged binary (local iteration)

# tuna-os publishes no minimal asahi tag today (only bonito:gnome-asahi and
# :gnome-asahi-testing), so this derives from a full GNOME image and is much
# larger than DESIGN.md's ~1.5 GB target. Dakota-asahi is the destination; the
# swap is this one variable, which is why it is a variable.

# Pinned, not floating. Issue #26 requires knowing exactly which fisherman a
# payload was tested against; a floating tag makes that unanswerable after the
# fact.
#
# This used to point at projectbluefin/fisherman, because tuna-os/fisherman
# lacked the explicit `mount -t` fix (a883428) without which an xfs root gets
# attempted as ext4 and the install dies. That was a workaround for a fork
# divergence, not a preference.
#
# tuna-os/fisherman is now synced (tuna-os/fisherman#59 brought over all 14
# commits, which also turned that fork's own CI from red to green) and carries
# two things projectbluefin does not: TPM2 enrolment on first boot, and the
# customMounts validation this project needs (#58 — rejects unsupported
# fstypes and refuses encryption on manual layouts, both of which are defects
# we hit here). So the pin now points at our own fork.

# TEMPORARY: head of tuna-os/fisherman#70, which adds -O verity to the
# manual-layout ext4 mkfs. bootc's --composefs-backend calls
# FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY, which ext4 refuses unless the feature was set at format
# time, so without this a composefs install onto customMounts fails *after* the
# target is formatted and the image deployed. Move to the merged SHA on dev
# once that PR lands.
