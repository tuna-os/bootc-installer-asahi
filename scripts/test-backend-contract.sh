# test-backend-contract.sh — hold the D2 backend to the contract D1 depends on.
#
# The macOS backend (asahi-installer --json machine mode) and the Linux
# first-boot agent are developed in different repos, in different languages,
# and are exercised by different test suites that never meet. The only thing
# joining them is <ESP>/asahi/stub_info.json: the backend records which
# partitions it created, and the agent uses that to decide which partition it
# is allowed to format.
#
# That is the most dangerous handoff in the project. If the backend renames
# "role", stops lowercasing "uuid", or drops a field, nothing fails until an
# agent on a real Mac either refuses to install or — far worse — resolves to
# the wrong partition. Both sides' tests would stay green the whole time,
# because each side tests its own idea of the shape.
#
# So this asserts the two agree, at a PINNED backend revision:
#
#   1. the backend's own --json protocol suite still passes at that revision
#      (24 tests, no macOS needed — they mock stdin/stdout);
#   2. the producer still emits every key the agent consumes, checked against
#      the backend's real source rather than against our fixtures;
#   3. the terminal result contract from issue #25: a failing run emits a
#      structured {"event":"result","status":"failure",...} line on stdout
#      AND exits non-zero. The backend's own suite tests util.emit_result()
#      in isolation (capsys mocks); none of it runs main.py and observes the
#      exit status, which is exactly the gap that let the pre-fix backend
#      catch every exception, print warnings, and fall through to exit 0.
#      This runs the real main.py --json with a failure injected and checks
#      the process-level behaviour, so a pin regression can't go green.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/test-backend-contract.sh

# Pinned deliberately, exactly like FISHERMAN_REV. "Which backend did we test
# against?" has to stay answerable after the fact, and a floating branch would
# make a green run mean nothing in a week.

# ── 3. The terminal result contract (issue #25) ───────────────────────────
# The pre-fix backend caught every exception (CalledProcessError, generic
# Exception), printed advice, and fell through to exit 0 with NO terminal
# event — so a driver treating exit 0 as its sole success observable told the
# user to bless and reboot an incomplete install. The fix (in the backend, at
# the pinned revision) emits one structured result event per run and exits
# non-zero on every failure. What is missing on THIS side is any CI-held
# check that the pinned backend actually does that: its own pytest suite only
# mocks util.emit_result() output and never observes the process exit status.
#
# So hold the PINNED backend to the process-level contract here. The injected
# failure needs no macOS, no disk and no network: a corrupt installer_data.json
# makes InstallerMain()'s constructor raise JSONDecodeError before any real
# probing happens, which is the generic-exception path the issue calls out.
# A pre-fix backend exits 0 with nothing on stdout; a fixed one exits 1 with
# {"event":"result","status":"failure","kind":"exception",...}.
