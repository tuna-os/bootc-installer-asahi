#!/usr/bin/env bash
# validate-catalog.sh — enforce that catalog.json's `verified` field is
# backed by evidence, not a hand flip. (#70)
#
# DESIGN.md's contract is a CI job that GENERATES catalog.json from
# registry-map.yaml, filtered through harness results per tuna-os/tunaOS#910.
# That generator does not exist: there is no registry-map.yaml and nothing
# feeds real harness output into this repo yet (it needs the ordered
# hardware checks in ROADMAP.md's Alpha checklist first). Until it does,
# `verified` was just a boolean a human could flip with no check at all —
# the exact gap #70 found.
#
# This is the minimal guard #70's own recommendation asked for in the
# meantime: every `verified: true` entry in catalog.json must have a
# matching record in docs/harness-results.json naming a clean pass (`N/N`,
# N>0) and a harnessRef a reviewer can open. Flipping the catalog boolean
# alone, with nothing else in the diff, now fails this check.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/validate-catalog.sh
